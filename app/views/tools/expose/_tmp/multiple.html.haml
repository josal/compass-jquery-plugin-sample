  This page contains two exposed elements whose exposing can be controlled with JavaScript buttons. Both exposed elements have different settings for the mask. Note that both exposes can be loaded
  = succeed "," do
    %em simultaneously
  a very unique feature of this tool.

%h3 HTML for the exposed elements
%p
  Exposed elements are simple
  = succeed "s" do
    %samp DIV
  that are styled with CSS:
%pii:code{:lang => "html"}
  ${html}
%h3 JavaScript coding
%p
  Here we initialize the Expose tool for the previous
  %samp DIV
  elements. Both exposes are configured so that the expose API is made availabe by setting the
  %samp api
  property to
  = succeed "." do
    %samp true
  The
  %samp lazy
  property is enabled so that the exposing effect won't be loaded upon page load. Both exposes are configured with a customized background color:
%pii:code
  ${js}
%h3 Buttons
%p
  Here are the action buttons. The container element has its
  %samp z-index
  set larger than 9999 so that it is always placed on top of the mask. The buttons simply use the
  %samp load
  and
  %samp close
  API methods.
%pii:code
  ${buttons}
