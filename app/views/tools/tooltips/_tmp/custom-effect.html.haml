  Here you can see a customized "bouncy" tooltip effect. We set up things similarly as in the
  = succeed "," do
    %a{:href => "index.html"} basic setup
  but we have modified the sliding effect with our own:
<%@ include file="custom-effect.htm" %>
%h3 HTML coding
%p
  A simple setup with the tooltip element and the triggers:
%pii:code{:lang => "html"}
  / tooltip triggers
  %img{:src => "image1.jpg", :title => "The tooltip text #1"}/
  %img{:src => "image2.jpg", :title => "The tooltip text #2"}/
  %img{:src => "image3.jpg", :title => "The tooltip text #3"}/
  %img{:src => "image4.jpg", :title => "The tooltip text #4"}/
%h3 Creating the effect
%p
  We start by adding a new animation algorithm for jQuery called "bouncy". This is possible by extending the
  %samp jQuery.easing
  object. I grabbed this easing function from the
  = succeed "'s" do
    %a.external{:href => "http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/"} jQuery Easing Plugin
  = succeed "." do
    %a.external{:href => "http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/jquery.easing.1.3.js"} source code
  There are quite a lot of different easing algorithms that you can try.
%p
  Custom tooltip effects are done with the
  %samp $.tools.tooltip.addEffect
  method. The first argument is the effect name, the second argument is the function that defines how the tooltip is shown and the third argument defines how the tooltip closes. Inside the functions the
  %samp this
  variable is a reference to the
  = succeed "." do
    %a{:href => "${jqt}/tooltip/index.html#api"} tooltip API
%pii:code
  ${effect}
%p
  %strong Note:
  you can get access to the configuration option with the
  %samp this.getConf()
  method, and you can use this object to supply custom configuration options as well.
%h3 JavaScript coding
%p
  Here is the tooltip configuration. We supply our newly created tooltip effect with the
  %samp effect
  configuration variable.
%pii:code
  ${js}
