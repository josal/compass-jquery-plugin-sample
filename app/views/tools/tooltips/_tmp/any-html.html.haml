  Tooltip content can be any HTML, not just plain text. Move your mouse over the Download button and you'll see a tooltip that contains an image, table and a link element. You can also see the
  %a{:href => "${jqt}/tooltip/index.html#slide"} slide effect
  in action.
%div{:style => "width:200px;margin:0 auto"}
  <%@ include file="any-html.htm" %>
%p
  You have enough time to move your cursor away from the trigger element and place it on top of the link that is contained inside the tooltip. You can also customize this delay from the
  = succeed "." do
    %a{:href => "${jqt}/tooltip/index.html#configuration"} tooltip configuration
%p
  Note that if the trigger has a
  %samp title
  attribute then the manual tooltip won't be displayed because the
  %samp title
  attribute overrides the manual tooltip.
%h3 HTML code
%p
  We have two things: a trigger element - which is the download button and the tooltip. By default, this tool assumes that the tooltip is placed right
  %em after
  the trigger element. As you can see we have a regular
  %samp DIV
  element working as the tooltip container and it can contain
  %em anything
  as opposed to the simple
  %samp title
  attribute in the previous demo.

%h3 CSS coding
%p
  The tooltip is styled with these settings. In this example we are using a black-arrowed background image. The important thing to notice here is that you have all the power of CSS when "skinning" the tooltip. You can change the background settings, colors, borders and fonts, etc.
%pii:code{:lang => "css"}
  ${css}
%h3 JavaScript code
%p
  We select the trigger element with the
  %samp #download_now
  selector. If we had chosen to use a class name instead of an
  = succeed "," do
    %samp ID
  we could select multiple triggers from the page and all of them would use the element that is positioned
  %em after the trigger
  as the tooltip.
%pii:code ${js}

  %strong Note:
  the slide effect is not included in the standard jQuery Tools distribution. You must download a
  %a{:href => "${jqt}/download/index.html#combine"} custom combination
  that includes this effect.
