      jQuery Mobile is built upon standard, semantic HTML, allowing pages to be accessible to the broadest range of devices possible. For A-Grade browsers, many of the components in jQuery Mobile leverage techniques such as focus management, keyboard navigation, and HTML attributes specified in the W3C's
      %a{:href => "http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/"} WAI-ARIA
      specification.
    %p
      By utilizing these techniques, we do our best to ensure an accessible experience to users with disabilities such as blindness, who may use screen readers (like
      = succeed "," do
        %em VoiceOver
      on Apple's iPhone device) or other assistive technology to access the web.
    %p While our accessibility implementation is currently a work in progress, we aim to provide a fully accessible suite of components for version 1.0.
