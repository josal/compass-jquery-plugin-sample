      New events available in jQuery Mobile
    %p
      jQuery Mobile offers several custom events that build upon native events to create useful
      hooks for development. Note that these events employ various touch, mouse, and window events,
      depending on event existence, so you can bind to them for use in both handheld and desktop
      environments. You can bind to these events like you would with other jQuery events, using
      %code
        live()
      or
      = succeed "." do
        %code
          bind()
    %ul
      %li
        %code
          tap
        Triggers after a quick, complete touch event.
      %li
        %code
          taphold
        Triggers after a held complete touch event (close to one second).
      %li
        %code
          swipe
        Triggers when a horizontal drag of 30px or more (and less than 20px vertically) occurs
        within 1 second duration.
      %li
        %code
          swipeleft
        Triggers when a swipe event occurred moving in the left direction.
      %li
        %code
          swiperight
        Triggers when a swipe event occurred moving in the right direction.
      %li
        %code
          orientationchange
        Triggers when a device orientation changes (by turning it vertically or horizontally).
        When bound to this event, your callback function can leverage a second argument, which
        contains an
        %code
          orientation
        property equal to either "portrait" or "landscape". These values are also added as classes
        to the HTML element, allowing you to leverage them in your CSS selectors. Note that we
        currently bind to the resize event when orientationChange is not natively supported.
      %li
        %code
          scrollstart
        Triggers when a scroll begins. Note that iOS devices freeze DOM manipulation during scroll,
        queuing them to apply when the scroll finishes. We're currently investigating ways to allow
        DOM manipulations to apply before a scroll starts.
      %li
        %code
          scrollstop
        Triggers when a scroll finishes.
    %h3
      Page show/hide events
    %p
      Whenever a page is shown or hidden in jQuery Mobile, two events are triggered on that page.
      The events triggered depend on whether that page is being shown or hidden, so when a page
      transition occurs, there are actually 4 events triggered: 2 for each page.
    %ul
      %li
        %code
          pagebeforeshow
        Triggered on the page being shown, before its transition begins.
      %li
        %code
          pagebeforehide
        Triggered on the page being hidden, before its transition begins.
      %li
        %code
          pageshow
        Triggered on the page being shown, after its transition completes.
      %li
        %code
          pagehide
        Triggered on the page being hidden, after its transition completes.
    %p
      Note that all four of these events expose a reference to either the next page (
      %code
        nextPage
      ) or previous page (
      %code
        prevPage
      ), depending on whether the page is being shown or hidden, and whether that next or previous
      page exists (the first ever page shown does not have a previous page to reference, but an empty
      jQuery object is provided just the same). You can access this reference via the second argument
      of a bound callback function. For example:
    %pre
      %code
        :preserve
          $('div').live('pageshow',function(event, ui){
            alert('This page was just hidden: '+ ui.prevPage);
          });
          
          $('div').live('pagehide',function(event, ui){
            alert('This page was just shown: '+ ui.nextPage);
          });
    %h3
      Page initialization events
    %p
      Internally, jQuery Mobile auto-initializes plugins based on the markup conventions found in
      a given "page". For example, an
      %code
        input
      element with a
      %code
        type
      of
      %code
        range
      will automatically generate a custom slider control.
    %p
      This auto-initialization is controlled by the "page" plugin, which dispatches events before
      and after it executes, allowing you to manipulate a page either pre-or-post initialization,
      or even provide your own intialization behavior and prevent the auto-initializations from
      occuring. Note that these events will only fire once per "page", as opposed to the show/hide
      events, which fire every time a page is shown and hidden.
    %ul
      %li
        %code
          pagebeforecreate
        Triggered on the page being initialized, before initialization occurs.
      %li
        %code
          pagecreate
        Triggered on the page being initialized, after initialization occurs.
    %p
      Note that by binding to
      %code
        pagebeforecreate
      and returning
      %code
        false
      , you can prevent the page plugin from making its manipulations.
    %h3
      Animation Events
    %p
      Currently, jQuery Mobile exposes the
      %code
        animationComplete
      event, which you can utilize after adding or removing a class that applies a CSS transition.
